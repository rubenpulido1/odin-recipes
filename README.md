In this project I will build a basic recipe website.
Demonstrating these key HTML principles:
1) Use of elements and tags
2) Writing out the HTML Boilerplate
3) Working with text elements (paragraphs, headings, strong, and em elements)
4) Working with lists (ordered, unordered, and list item elements).
